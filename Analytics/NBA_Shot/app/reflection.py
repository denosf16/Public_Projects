    #### ✅ 1. Feature & Interaction Review
    - **Raw features to reintroduce or engineer:**
      - `TOUCH_TIME` (as raw + interaction)
      - `DRIBBLES`
      - `PERIOD`, `GAME_CLOCK`
      - `SHOT_TYPE` (2PT vs 3PT)
      - `SHOT_CLOCK` (binned or logged)
    
    - **New interaction ideas:**
      - `SHOT_DIST × CLOSE_DEF_DIST`
      - `DRIBBLES × SHOT_DIST`
      - `TOUCH_TIME × DRIBBLES`

    **Next Step:** Visualize feature distributions and run MI / SHAP / logit coeffs.

    st.markdown("""
    #### 🧪 Expand with PolynomialFeatures
    - Use `PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, interaction_only=True)` to auto-generate second-order terms.
    - Wrap in a pipeline: `StandardScaler → Poly → LogisticRegression`

    #### ⚖️ Regularization Search
    ```python
    {
        'penalty': ['l1', 'l2'],
        'C': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10],
        'solver': ['liblinear', 'saga']
    }
    ```
    - Use `GridSearchCV` or `LogisticRegressionCV` with `neg_log_loss`.

    **Goal:** Improve flexibility without losing interpretability.

    #### 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning
    ```python
    {
        'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
        'max_depth': [3, 5, 10, None],
        'min_samples_leaf': [1, 10, 50, 100],
        'max_features': ['sqrt', 'log2', None]
    }
    ```
    - Use `RandomizedSearchCV`, scoring by `neg_log_loss`

    #### 📊 Prune with Feature Importances
    - Extract `.feature_importances_`, drop lowest-ranked features
    - Retrain to improve generalization

    **Goal:** Tighten prediction variance, reduce coarse binning.

    | Model     | Calibration     | Residual Spread | Shot Distance Bias | Notes                                 |
    |-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
    | logreg_v2 | Fair            | Symmetric, wide  | Strong underfit     | Best recall, poor rim resolution       |
    | rf_v3     | Good            | Bimodal, coarse  | Slight residual bias | Conservative, safe but imprecise      |
    | xgb_v2    | Excellent       | Tight, centered  | None                | Best spatial modeling + calibration    |

    **Diagnostic Takeaways:**
    - Logistic: Linear structure limits spatial flexibility.
    - RF: Improved with tuning, still prone to hard cutoffs.
    - XGB: Best overall performer — spatially intelligent, calibrated.

    #### 📊 Grouped Evaluation — Key Wins
    - **0–10 ft:** RF_v3 and XGB_v2 outperform others (rim touch modeling).
    - **Mid-range (10–25 ft):** All models converge — feature ceiling.
    - **Clutch, Contested, Mismatch:** XGB_v2 consistently wins.

    #### 📌 Insight:
    XGB_v2 generalizes best in volatile contexts. RF_v3 is reliable but rigid. Logistic regression fails to separate complex scenarios.

    st.header("🧪 Calibration & Residual Diagnostics")
    st.markdown("""
    - **Calibration:** XGB_v2 is closest to ideal. RF_v3 improved but still slightly underconfident at low scores.
    - **QQ Plots:**
      - Logistic: clear S-curve → underfitting
      - RF: plateaus from vote-counting
      - XGB: closest to normality, best residual flow
    - **Residuals vs SHOT_DIST:**
      - LogReg → strong upward slope (bias)
      - RF → step-wise improvements, RF_v3 nearly flat
      - XGB → flattest trend, lowest variance
    - **Residual Histograms:**
      - RF models are sharply bimodal (overconfident)
      - XGB_v2 is symmetrical and smooth

    ✅ Conclusion: XGB_v2 = Best fit, lowest variance, sharpest probability control.
